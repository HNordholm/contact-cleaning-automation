This script cleans contact info. It imports the data from an XLSX file, then makes sure phone numbers are all in the same format. It pulls out apartment, suite, or unit info into its own column to keep things clean.

It also combines multiple email addresses into one entry, gets rid of duplicates, and merges records with the same name while keeping the best info. It checks that ZIP codes are 5 digits and rearranges the columns to keep everything organized.

When itâ€™s done, it saves the cleaned-up data back into an excel file, ready to use.
